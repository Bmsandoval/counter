# counter

Counter (badly named) will be a golang-based successor to "DCSB", but focused more on the counter (death or otherwise)

## Project Plan

### Goal:

click a global hotkey and increment an integer stored in a file

### Problem:

* DCSB doesn't work on MacOS
* OBS text display accepts a constant string, or pulling from a file

### Requirements:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
[/] Read from/Write to file

[/] Global Hotkeys

[] Possible to manage file and hotkeys
=======
* [ ]  Configure unit tests
  * [ ]  Enable dependency injection
* [ ]  Better logging

### v0.2:

* [ ]  user defined file location
* [ ]  tests (you win this time DevNinYa)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

* TUI/GUI?
* For quick POC, could be passed in as flags


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Future:
=======
* [ ]  GUI
* [ ]  read keyboard input to set user defined hotkey
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

* Soundboard - randomly select sound from folder
