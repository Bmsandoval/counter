# counter

Counter (badly named) will be a golang-based successor to "DCSB", but focused more on the counter (death or otherwise)

## Project Plan

### Goal:

click a global hotkey and increment an integer stored in a file

### Problem:

* DCSB doesn't work on MacOS
* OBS text display accepts a constant string, or pulling from a file

### Requirements:

[/] Read from/Write to file

[/] Global Hotkeys

[] Possible to manage file and hotkeys

* TUI/GUI?
* For quick POC, could be passed in as flags


### Future:

* Soundboard - randomly select sound from folder
